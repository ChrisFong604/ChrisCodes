# My Personal Portfolio

StaticPortfolio is the static React client hosted at [my website](chriscodes.me). 
### How to run

1. Clone the directory
2. Install the dependencies from the root folder by running executing ```npm install```
3. Within the local folder, execute ```npm start``` from the root folder. The application will be hosted on http://localhost:3000
### Future plans

In the future, I am hoping to implement:

* Blog feature
* User authentication system + inputs for website information

Eventually, this client will be integrated into a full-stack application with fully functioning REST APIs for various features.
